# TASK 1 - CALCULATE AREA OF RECTANGLE

# Write a python program that allows the user to calculate area of rectangle with sides a and b. The program should allow the user to enter length of both sides of the rectangle and output the resulting area.

# The following example shows a test run of the program

# Enter length of side a: 2
# Enter length of side b: 4
# Area of rectangle is 8.

print('Ennter length of side a: ')
a = int(input())
print('Ennter length of side b: ')
b = int(input())
print('Area of rectangle is',a*b)
