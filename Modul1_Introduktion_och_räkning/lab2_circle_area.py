# TASK 2 - CALCULATE AREA OF CIRCLE

# Write a python program that calculates area of circle of radius r. The program should allow the user to enter the value of r and output the resulting area. Value of the area must be printed with two decimals precision, that is, with at most two digits after the decimal point. Assume that pi = 3.14

# The following example shows a test run of the program

# Enter length of radius r: 8
# Area of the circle is 200.96

print('Enter length of radius r:')
a = float(input())
print("Area of the circle is", 3.14*a*a)
